# This package will contain the spiders of the Scrapy project.

# Note:
# Our convention is to individually enable required item pipelines for each
# spider in the spider custom_settings property. All pipelines are enabled by
# default, see pipelines.py for available pipelines.

# Please refer to the documentation for information on how to create and manage
# your spiders.
